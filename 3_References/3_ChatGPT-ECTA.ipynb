we shall consider only the case k=2.\\nif k>2 we have more equations than unknown quantities. if our as-\\nsumption that the indicator is a polynomial of the second degree were\\nexactly true and if our observations were without error, then it would\\nbe possible to choose the quantities wi, - - - , wex_1 such that the equa-\\ntions (7) are exactly fulfilled. but this is certainly not the case. there\\nare many sources of errors. not all individuals considered have exactly\\nthe same scale of preferences, the individuals do not choose exactly the\\nset of goods for which the indicator has the greatest value, the goods\\ncompared in different periods are not exactly of the same quality, and\\nso on. different errors will arise even in the statistical determination\\ndetermination of indifference surfaces 149\\nof prices and quantities. for all these reasons we cannot expect that the\\nequations (7) can be fulfilled exactly. let us denote w:p:,;—wwopo,;

the expression\\nqizy — azz 2\\n6= 27d (ai — a)? or 8 = rr):\\ni to | as | + | ay |\\nwe have to calculate the values wi, - + + , we.-1 which make 6 a mini-\\nmum. but this calculation is in general too complicated. for practical\\npurposes it will be sufficient to calculate wi, -- - , wex1 from the first\\n2k—1 equations of (7), namely from the equations:\\nw2p2,1 — po = wipi,2 — po,2,\\nw3p3,1 — po,1 = w1p1,3 — pd,3)\\n(8) co ee\\nwek—-1p2%k—-1,1 — po,l = w1p1,2k-1 — p0,2k—-1,\\nws3p3,2 — po,2 = w2p2,3 — po,3-\\nif our assumptions are approximately true then the values wi, - +», wex—1\\nthus calculated should come near to the values which make 6 a mini-\\nmum.\\nsolving the first 2k—2 equations of (8) we get\\nwipi,t — pos + por .\\n(9) w= (i =2,++-,2k—1).\\npil\\nsubstituting in the last equation of (8) for w: and ws;

will not greatly change the values\\nof w; @=2,---, 2k—1). but we cannot say the same about the equa-\\ntion (10). the denominator on the right-hand side of (10) will often\\nbe near to zero and we cannot determine the value of w: with great\\naccuracy. small changes in the values of p;,; will perhaps change greatly\\nthe value of w,. the reason for this fact is the following: we know that\\nevery monotonically increasing function f(z) of j is also an indicator.\\nwe get here a unique solution for the indicator because we consider\\nthat indicator which is a polynomial of the second degree. it is true\\nthat f(z) is a second-degee polynomial only if f is linear, but f(j)\\ncan be well approximated in a small region by a polynomial of the\\nsecond degree, even if f(z) is not linear, for instance, if f(i)=log i\\nor = (j). the polynomial of the second degree j* which approximates\\nf (j), taken as an indicator, will describe a system of indifference sur-\\nfaces which will not be identical with that described by j, but they\\nwill not differ much. however, the value of w; can be quite different\\nif we take j* instead of i as an indicator. the circumstance that wi\\ncannot be determined with good accuracy does not mean any disad-\\nvantage. a change in the value of w; means only that we get j* instead\\nof j as an indicator, where i* is a polynomial of the second degree,\\nwhich approximates a certain function f(z) of j. the indifference\\nsurfaces themselves will be very little affected by it.\\n\\nthe measure of asymmetry 6 can be calculated after having deter-\\nmined w1, --- , wex1. if we make assumptions about the nature of the\\nerrors, we can deduce statistical criteria when 6 can be regarded as\\nsignificant. this question will not be discussed here. if 6 is not to be\\nregarded as significant, we substitute for the matrix a a symmetrical\\none, substituting for the elements a:,;= w.p:,;—po,j and @j,i= w3pj,i— po,\\ntheir arithmetic mean &;,;=4(ai,;+4;,1).\\n\\nsince according to (6)\\n\\no°f o°f\\n—— =a;;

without referring to the goods in k,. hence we\\ncan say:\\n\\nif a subset k, of consumers’ goods is semi-independent of the set of alj\\nother consumers’ goods, then we can restrict ourselves to the consideration of\\nk, and all results of the previous section can be well applied to the subset k1,\\n\\nthis fact enables us to apply the theory to small sets of consumers’\\ngoods. it seems very plausible that the set of all foods is not only\\nsemi-independent, but also independent of all other consumers’ goods.\\nwithin the set of foods it will scarcely be possible to form a subset\\nwhich is independent of all other foods, whereas subsets of foods which\\nare semi-independent of all other foods very probably can be formed.\\nfor instance, the set of all sorts of bread will be perhaps semi-independ-\\nent of all other foods.\\n\\niv. some applications and remarks\\n\\n1. calculation of the demand functions. one of the most important\\nproblems which can be solved if we know the shape of the indifference\\nsurfaces is the determination of the demand functions for consumers’\\ngoods, that is to say, the determination of the engel curve in any given\\nprice system.\\n\\nas we have pointed out in section i, the indicator is determined only\\nin the linear space s determined by the engel curves considered. there-\\nfore we shall be able to determine the engel curve corresponding to a\\ngiven price system only in case the engel curve lies in s.\\n\\nlet us consider k time periods, h,---, &%, and the corresponding\\nengel curves ci, --- , cy. at first we have to formulate the necessary\\nand sufficient conditions which must be satisfied by a price system\\np=p\\',---, p\" in order that the engel curve c corresponding to p\\nshould lie in the linear space s determined by ci, - - - , cr.\\n\\nwe shall call the system of the n marginal utilities i/dq\\', - - -, di/aq\"\\nthe marginal utility. to each point q of the quantity space belongs a\\ncertain marginal-utility vector, which we shall denote by w(q). since\\nthe marginal-utility vector w(q) is a linear function of g, when the in-\\ndicator is a polynomial of the second degree in q, it is obvious that,\\nfor each point q of the linear space determined by ci, - - - , cz, w(q) can\\nbe represented as a vector sum:\\n\\n2k—-1\\nw(q) = > yew (qr);\\nwhere qo;-2 and qo;-1 denote two different points of the engel curve c;\\n(t=1,--+,k) and vo, --- , v2x-1 are certain numbers.\\nthis content downloaded from\\n137.158.158.62 on wed, 26 jan 2022 12:33:45 utc\\nall use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\\n\\n172 a. wald\\n\\nsince the marginal-utility vector in each point of the engel curve c;\\nis proportional to the price vector p; of the period t;, the vector sum\\n>> »,(q-) is equal to the vector sum dh ikipi, where ki, - - - , kx denote\\nsome numbers. hence for each point qg of s the vector w(q) is a linear\\ncombination of the price vectors pi,---, px. from this fact follows\\neasily: in order that the engel curve c corresponding to the price vec-\\ntor p should lie in s, it is necessary and sufficient that the price vector p\\nshould be a linear combination of the price vectors pi, -- + , dx. hence\\nwe shall consider only the case\\n(54) pp = mpi +++ + + ede,\\nwhere pi, °°: , #z are certain numbers. if & is equal to the dimension\\nof the quantity space and the vectors pi, - - : , px are linearly independ-\\nent, then any price vector p can be represented in the form of (54),\\nthat is to say, in this case we are able to calculate the engel curve corre-\\nsponding to any price vector p.\\n\\nif the isovalue space s* (that is, the space where the marginal-utility\\nof money is equal to zero, see p. 163) is not 0-dimensional, then the\\nengel curve is not uniquely determined by the price vector, but only\\nthe projection of the engel curve on a linear space s’ perpendicular\\nto s* is uniquely determined. the set of all engel curves corresponding\\nto a certain price vector p, can be obtained as follows: denote by c\\none of the possible engel curves corresponding to p, and denote by q\\na point of c not lying in s*. we put through qa linear space s parallel\\nto s* and of the same dimension. the set of all possible engel curves is\\nidentical with the set of all straight lines joining s with s*. we can re-\\nstrict ourselves to the determination of one of the possible engel curves.\\n\\na point q, for which\\n(55) w(q) = mpi + +++ + epa;\\nis certainly a point of an engel curve corresponding to the price vector\\np=mpit +--+ +uxps. hence we will determine the point q for which\\n(55) holds true.\\n\\ndenote by e* the income in the period ¢;

if we consider only a region t of the quantity\\nspace, where the engel curves can be well approximated by straight\\nlines, and if the diameter of tj is not much greater than the greatest\\nlength of the parts of the engel curves contained in t, then we have all\\nreason to assume that the indicator i(q), provided that one exists, can\\nbe approximated by a polynomial of the second degree. hence in such\\ncases we are justified in saying that the hypothesis of the existence of a\\nsystem of indifference surfaces which remained unchanged during the\\nperiod of observations is to be rejected. hence this method enables us\\nto examine whether the indifference surfaces of a certain group of in-\\ndividuals remained unchanged during the period of observations, or\\nwhether different groups of individuals observed in the same time\\nperiod have an identical system of indifference surfaces.\\n\\ncolumbia university\\n\\nnew york city\\n\\n7 see the writer’s paper on index numbers in zeitschrift fiir nationalékonomie,\\nwien, 1937.\\n\\nthis content downloaded from\\n137.158.158.62 on wed, 26 jan 2022 12:33:45 utc\\nall use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\\n\\n'"

In addition, one should try\\n\\nto make it harder to lie while keeping a good reputation, for example, via transparency,\\n\\nnaming-and-shaming, or reputation systems (e.g., Bg, Slemrod, and Thoresen (2015)).\\nThere are at least four potential caveats for these policy implications. First, we would\\n\\nnot normally base recommendations on a single lab experiment. Given that our meta\\n\\nstudy provides very strong, large-scale evidence, however, we feel confident that truth-\\ntelling is a robust phenomenon. Second, lab experiments are not ideal to pin down the\\nprecise value of policy-relevant parameters. We would thus not put much emphasis on\\nthe exact value of, say, the average amount of lying, which we measure as 0.234. How-\\never, it is clear that, whatever the exact value is, it is far away from 1. Third, none of\\nour results suggests that all people in all circumstances will shy away from lying maxi-\\nmally. Any mechanism that relies on voluntary truth-telling will need to be robust to some\\nparticipants acting rationally and robust to self-selection of rational participants into the\\nmechanism. Finally, the FFH paradigm does not capture several aspects that could affect\\nreporting. Subjects have to report and they have to report a single number. This excludes\\nlies by omission or vagueness (Serra-Garcia, Van Damme, and Potters (2011)). From the\\nviewpoint of the subject, there is also little ambiguity about whether they lied or not. In\\nreality, a narrative for reporting a higher state while still maintaining a self-image of hon-\\nesty might be easier to generate (Bénabou, Falk, and Tirole (2018), Mazar, Amir, and\\nAriely (2008)).\\nREFERENCES\\n\\nABELER, J.
