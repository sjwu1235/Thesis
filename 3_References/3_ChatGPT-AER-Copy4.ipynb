      "explanations of the rules governing discussion and vot-\n",
      "ing were identical to those of PL, although the organiza-\n",
      "tion was altered. The only procedural changes were that\n",
      "our chairman was elected by the subjects and that our\n",
      "instructions required the chairman to use a coin flip to\n",
      "decide an issue after 3 tie votes. (The PL instructions\n",
      "required the committee to move to consider the “next\n",
      "issue” after 3 ties).\n",
      "\n",
      "We used the PL choice-of-banquet agenda as an\n",
      "example. The agendas used in our experiments were\n",
      "explained and drawn in the same manner as those of\n",
      "PL, and our Agenda Test was patterned after theirs.\n",
      "Unlike PL, our experiments involved multiple meetings,\n",
      "which were described:\n",
      "\n",
      "“After earnings have been recorded for the first meet-\n",
      "ing, we will collect your page 6 (marked First Meeting)\n",
      "and distribute a new page 6 with an agenda for the\n",
      "second meeting and a new Earnings Table, which will\n",
      "be different from your earnings table for the first meet-\n",
      "ing. You will receive a new page 6 at the beginning of\n",
      "each subsequent meeting. There will be a large number\n",
      "of meetings. The total amount that you earn, which is\n",
      "yours to keep, is the sum of the amounts that you earn\n",
      "in the individual committee meetings.”\n",
      "\n",
      "In our complete information experiments, we had the\n",
      "subjects elect a monitor to tell voters the number of\n",
      "people with each earnings-induced preference ordering\n",
      "over committee decisions. The types of preference or-\n",
      "derings and the role of the monitor were explained:\n",
      "\n",
      "“There are three types of voters participating in each\n",
      "committee meeting. Each committee member has a dif-\n",
      "ferent earnings table, but type (i) committee members\n",
      "have the highest earnings for outcome A, type (ii) have\n",
      "the highest earnings for outcome B, and type (iii) have\n",
      "the highest earnings for outcome C. Of course, you fall\n",
      "into one of these three categories. The voters who have\n",
