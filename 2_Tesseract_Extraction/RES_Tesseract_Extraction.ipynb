I am  following the code and technique from this article on how to read a multi-column pdf. The fitz python module is a lightweight pdf reader, it will require the installation of pyMupdf. OpenCV python module and the module/class cv2 from it is used to apply otsu's thresholding technique to lift/determine paragraph edges. \n",

CONCLUDING COMMENTS\\n\\nThe principal purpose of this paper has been to identify the primary determinants of\\nmoney wage changes in Canadian manufacturing industries at the two-digit level of dis-\\naggregation. Although the evidence is subject to several limitations, it is generally consistent\\nwith the view that in the majority of industries wage changes are associated with changes\\nin the relative wage (i.e., the industry's wage relative to the general wage level in Canada),\\nand in the general level of unemployment. The influence of the demand for labour, as\\nmeasured in our tests, is also discernible in a majority of industries. The factors that show\\nthrough least clearly are the level of wages in the same industry in the United States and\\nindustry profits.\\n\\nThis evidence is broadly consistent with the aggregative wage-change relationships\\nthat have been estimated for various countries including Canada. Moreover, the estimates\\nemphasize that general economic conditions have an important influence on wage changes\\nin particular industries in comparison with influences that are peculiar to particular indus-\\ntries. Although all the variables entering these relationships reflect the general economic\\nconditions prevailing in the country, these environmental factors are directly reflected in\\nthe level of unemployment in the community and the overall level of wages. In quite a\\nnumber of industries the influence of these environmental factors seems to be conditioned\\nby variations in the demand for labour in particular industries.\\n\\nThe limited information that is available provides little evidence of a significant\\nassociation between strikes and the rate of change in wages negotiated under collective\\nagreements. In addition, the degree of unionization across industries is not significantly\\ncorrelated with the rate of change in wages across industries from 1961 to 1966, nor does\\nit seemed to be related in a systematic way to the role of profits and United States wages\\nin influencing wage changes in Canadian manufacturing industries.\\n\\nLittle or no evidence has been found to support the key industry hypothesis for Canada.\\nThe identity of the key group of Canadian industries is in doubt; the existence of the as-\\nsumed bargaining cycle is in doubt; and when wage changes in an assumed key group of\\nCanadian industries are related to wage changes in particular industries, it is doubtful\\nwhether these key industry wage changes are any more closely associated with wage changes\\nin non-key industries than are wage changes in manufacturing generally.\\n\\nSomething can be made of the key group hypothesis if instead of defining the key group\\nin terms of industries it is defined in terms of employees covered by collective bargaining\\nunits. The evidence is consistent with the view that the wage settlements arrived at\\nby collective bargaining units for the economy generally are positively related to wage\\nchanges in many individual Canadian industries. However, because of the close relation-\\nship between wage changes arrived at in collective bargaining settlements for the economy\\nas a whole and general labour-market conditions, it has not been possible to identify\\nsatisfactorily the separate influence of the spill-over effects per se of collective bargaining\\non wage changes in particular industries and the influence of general labour market\\nconditions.\\n\\nUniversity of Western Ontario G.

When the covariance matrix is measured, it is\\npossible to compute directly the matrices G, H and Z in the main hypotheses R(1) and R(2)\\nand leave f, the utility function parameter, as the only coefficient to be estimated. This\\nwas done and fi was estimated separately for each equation and by pooling the data for all\\nthe variables. The results were that the single equation estimates of f varied wildly between\\nequations and the unique estimate from the pooled data was very badly defined. The\\nimplication of this would seem to be that the errors in proxying rate expectations are trans-\\nmitted in an accentuated form to proxying of the covariance matrix.\\n\\nSome attempts were also made on the basis of variations in rates of return about their\\nhistorical means to compute covariance matrices for sub-periods. The difficulty with this\\nis deciding upon the length of period to take. If the period is too short, the elements of\\nthe matrix are minute. If the period is too long, there is very little variation in the elements\\nof the matrix. No progress was made with this problem.\\n\\nThe main outcome of a considerable amount of largely unsuccessful work reported in\\nthis section is that it is difficult to improve on the results reported in the previous section,\\nbut that if goodness of fit is our only aim, then introducing an autoregressive element into\\nthe model via adjustment costs is one way of achieving that aim.\\n\\n5. CONCLUSIONS\\n\\nThe aim of this study was to explain Discount House portfolio and debt behaviour in\\nterms of a simple but strongly specified model of rational choice in conditions of uncertainty.\\nThe model advanced made strong assumptions about\\n\\n(a) the Discount House utility function;\\n\\n(b) the competitiveness of the bill, Short Bond and money markets;\\n\\n(c) the constancy of subjective variances and covariances of asset yields and borrowing\\nrates.\\n\\nSome data mining took place in order to establish the ** best \"\" proxies for expected rates of\\nreturn but measurement error in these expected rates inevitably remains.\\n\\nThe main empirical findings are that the model postulated explains a good proportion\\nof the portfolio and debt changes of the Discount Houses. Almost all the coefficients\\nrelating asset and liability levels to interest rates are well determined despite high inter-\\ncorrelation between the independent variables, and have signs which confirm a priori\\nexpectations. The majority of the a priori specifying restrictions were tolerably well satisfied\\nwhen the equations were freely estimated. The variant of the model which assumes that\\nuncertainty surrounds both borrowing and lending behaviour is marginally superior to\\nthe variant which assumes that the planning period is short enough for borrowing rates to\\nbe known with certainty.\\n\\nThe popular view that the working of the institutions central to the U.K. monetary\\nsystem cannot be explained in terms of simple models and that their behaviour is so unstable\\nthat it is virtually impossible to make predictions, seems to be wrong. This simple model\\nexplains a large part of the movements in the Discount Houses\\' Balance Sheets over the past\\n15 years. It does not explain it all, however, and there is plenty of scope for improvement.\\nSome of the more immediately obvious avenues of further enquiry have been explored but\\nthere must be many others which would repay further work.\\n\\nUniversity of Essex M.

When all three are\\nincluded, N(?) and N(t—1) have negative coefficients and R? is 0-92. When U(t— 1) is\\nomitted from the equation, R? drops to 0:89, but both N(t) and N(t— 1) then have signi-\\nficant positive coefficients. But both sets of estimates show that the lag between inventory\\nchanges and orders is considerably shorter in Textiles than in Engineering.\\n\\nTotal stock equations\\n\\nThe results of Table 3 are broadly consistent with those of Tables 1 and 2. In most\\ncases the coefficient of X(r) is now larger, which should be expected since the work in\\nprogress component has been added to the dependent variables of previous equations.\\nFor all manufacturing the interest rate coefficient is again significant; the short-run interest\\nelasticity of investment is —1-:27 compared with the sales elasticity of 12-3. The results\\nfor the Engineering group (Table 4) now show that the coefficients of N(t— 1), N(t—2) and\\nN(t— 3) are all positive, the latter two being larger and more significant. This is no more\\nthan a confirmation of a priori expectations that an increase in new orders would lead to\\nincreases in work in progress much sooner than increases in finished goods. It must also\\nbe borne in mind that the work in progress component in this group is large absolutely and\\nrelatively. Had our sample size been larger, more complex lag structures would have been\\ninvestigated.

Secondly our initial results\\nsuggest that a more thorough analysis of the stockbuilding behaviour of industries producing\\nmainly to order would be worthwhile. Thirdly as our results do not provide much evidence\\nshowing the production smoothing considerations to be very important in all industries,\\nmodels of short-run output behaviour could throw more light on the behaviour of finished\\ngoods stocks.

      "{'found': 'ON THE EFFICIENCY OF COMPETITIVE PROGRAMMES 581\\n\\nsatisfy the conditions of section 2, then all competitive programmes are efficient, but it\\nseems unlikely that the technology is that special.\\n\\nThis brings us to a second direction research could take: modification (or extension)\\nof our institutional framework. We dealt above with a model in which independent firms\\nmaximize present value over finite horizons. If, for example, we assumed instead that\\nfirms maximize over infinite horizons, our conclusions would undoubtedly be modified.\\nIndeed, it is hard to see how such a firm would rationally hold ** too much capital\\nforever! ; the economy still might (if the number of firms is growing), but should be less\\nlikely to.\\n\\nNote also that our analysis has had the character of partial equilibrium; we have\\nignored the problems of consumer choice and the associated distributional aspects of\\ncompetition. Introducing consumers who maximize over preference orderings subject to a\\nbudget constraint could also alter the conclusions of this paper. Again the results will\\ndepend on what planning period is chosen for consumer optimization. One view regards\\nthe family as the unit of decision making, and thus insists on having an infinite horizon for\\nthe optimization of the family. An alternative view suggests a finite life for every consumer\\nand a planning horizon identical with his life. It is then suggested that the consumer end\\nhis life either with no capital or with the amount dictated by a bequest motive.\\n\\nIf we regard consumers or families as optimizing over infinite horizons, then in defining\\ntheir budget constraint over this planning period we are assuming something about the\\nbehaviour of the capital market. That is, the capital market has some operating rules that\\ndetermine the limitations on the borrowing and lending capabilities of individuals. Such\\nrules can be analogous, for example, to the rule of * dying without debts \" in the finite life\\ncase. Consequently, such rules have implications for the aggregate rate of capital accumu-\\nlation (see Arrow and Kurz [1, Ch. 7] for extensive discussion of the implications of alter-\\nnative budget constraints). Therefore, it is conceivable that there may exist appropriate rules\\nthat will ensure the efficiency of a competitive programme along which consumers obey\\nthese borrowing rules.\\n\\nIt is easy to show, however, that for an economy with growing population the condition\\nof * zero capital at the end of the consumer\\'s finite life \" is perfectly consistent with a\\ndivergent aggregate capital stock and economic inefficiency (see Starrett [15, Ch. 6]). From\\nthis it follows that a competitive equilibrium that would be defined relative to such con-\\nsumer optimization and individual budget constraint can be inefficient. Thus, it appears\\nimportant to investigate budget constraints and corresponding definitions of competitive\\nequilibria that might ensure competitive efficiency. We believe this to be a problem for\\nfurther research.\\n\\nStanford University M. Kunz\\nD. A.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUDING REMARKS\\n\\nThis paper derives and tests directly the influence on investment behaviour of relative\\nprice and productive input variables and interprets the empirical results in terms of assumed\\nproduction and adjustment cost conditions and expected price formation behaviour.\\nResults from testing a range of different investment equations within the same general\\ntheoretical framework provide evidence of statistically significant depreciable capital user\\ncost and wage rate relative prices and corresponding productive factor variables, depreciable\\ncapital and labour. The results provide no evidence of an important role for liquid capital\\nvariables in influencing investment, except for a possible substitution effect resulting from\\nchanges in liquid capital user costs.\\n\\nIn contrast to most investment studies this paper places much more importance on\\ndifferent relative prices as influences on investment behaviour and specifically excludes an\\noutput measure in investment equations. While it may be argued that the output or acceler-\\nator influence is operative through (say) depreciable capital and labour levels which imply\\nan associated potential output level, capital and labour variables were included because\\nof their ** capacity \"\\' influence stemming from their costs of adjustment and not to represent\\nan accelerator influence. This approach is consistent with the structure of capacity acceler-\\nator models [8, 9, 13, 17, 28] but here relative prices replace output variables as the exo-\\ngenous determinants of desired capital stock and depreciable capital and labour variables\\nrepresent an expanded interpretation of current capacity.\\n\\nIt may also be argued that the importance of the time trend variable is due not only\\nto systematic shifts over time in production and adjustment cost functions or price expecta-\\ntion behaviour, but also to changes in demand conditions not fully captured by the inclusion\\nof an output price index. If this is the case, however, it would seem more appropriate to\\nmodify output demand conditions to include a shift variable such as national income, rather\\nthan introduce an output measure or output changes. Since this shift variable finds its way\\ninto the derived demand equation for investment goods, the combination of shift variable\\nand factor prices determines desired capitalstocks.! For that matter a demand shift variable\\nmay well represent the economic force in neo-classical models that output or sales variables\\nrepresent in accelerator models which treat output as exogenous.\\n\\nThe empirical results presented here suggest that the extension of investment models\\nto include labour price and input variables represents a more logical step than that followed\\nin past studies where liquid capital variables have been included in the absence of labour\\nmeasures [31, 32]. However, while certain types of ** liquidity \" variables did not perform\\nwell empirically, the underlying model does not incorporate the internal-external investment\\nfunds cost difference which liquidity theorists believe to lie at the heart of the internal\\nfunds flow influence on investment behaviour. Modification of the model to incorporate\\nthese cost differences in the cost of capital or liquid capital user cost variable would be\\nnecessary to test this hypothesis directly.\\n\\nCornell University R.

This follows because the independent variable\\n\\n(R,, 7 0-1)\\n\\nis effectively the same in both sets of regressions since the Lutzian and Hicksian forward\\nrates differ only minutely for the first forward rate (j — 2, Table 1), but the dependent\\nvariable will have greater variance in the Lutzian case due to the greater elasticity of these\\nrates. The variances of the dependent variable in these regressions confirm this in that for\\nthe British data all variances of the dependent variable are greater for the Lutzian case and\\nin the Durand data this is true for ten of the thirteen regressions. The Meiselman model\\nwas not initially very strong in explaining the change in forward rates for longer time spans\\n(n7 4) and the results presented here show that any explanatory power that it did have\\nwas overstated.

      "{'found': 'A REPLY\\n\\nDr Bliss starts his note by claiming a contradiction between results reached by Professor\\nDebreu and my conclusion (pp. 425-6) that a process of net saving does not necessarily lead\\nto a new equilibrium. This claim appears to be based on a misunderstanding of the argu-\\nment in my paper. According to Dr Bliss, ** the equilibrium under discussion . . . is a mo-\\nmentary equilibrium \" and the ** major fault \" in the argument is *\\' the illicit importation\\nof long-period equilibrium theory into the analysis of a short-run situation \". Thus, he\\nassumes I was concerned with the short-period situation *\\' in which the price system was\\nadjusted to the new pattern of demand and the old capital stock \". (Debreu\\'s results do\\nrefer to such short-run equilibria). But my paper, in fact, deals exclusively with long-run\\nequilibria. In the pages Dr Bliss refers to, the problem is whether the process of net saving\\ncan lead to a new /ong-run equilibrium, and whether this can happen without changes in r\\nand w so drastic as to make implausible the traditional explanation of distribution.\\n\\nThe process of transition to such a long-run equilibrium does, indeed, by itself raise a\\nnumber of difficulties for the demand and supply theory of distribution. As I noted, the\\nconclusions of the theory would after Keynes be qualified as applying either ** in the absence\\nof risk and uncertainty \" or under the hypothesis of an appropriate monetary policy.! It\\nwas also noted how the changes in the physical form of the capital stock as it adapts to the\\nnew methods and outputs, may undermine the very notion of saving used in the theory.?\\nAII these additional difficulties were, however, ruled out from the main line of the argument\\n(see assumptions (c) and (d), p. 425). This was done in order to focus the analysis on one\\ncentral deficiency, and show that, even if the process of transition could be assumed to work\\nsmoothly in those respects, it might still lead to no new long-run equilibrium, or to no\\nplausible one, because the fall of r might be accompanied by a decrease, and not an increase\\nin the proportion of *\\' capital \" to labour in the economy.\\n\\nDr Bliss however seems to imply that an analysis conducted by means of a sequence\\nof ** momentary \" equilibria, far from bringing out additional weaknesses of the theory,\\ncould show that a new long-run equilibrium might be reached, even where the proportion\\nof ** capital\" to labour falls together with r. But, as far as I am aware, no such argument\\nhas been advanced before.\\n\\nIn fact, the demand and supply explanation of distribution seems faced, at the present\\nmoment, by two alternatives. On the one hand, there is a long-run analysis undermined by\\nthe inconsistencies of the notion of capital it must use. On the other hand, there are short-\\nperiod analyses where the attempt to avoid these inconsistencies (by referring to heterogen-\\neous capital goods) leaves room for the doubts, which Dr Bliss himself expresses, about\\nthe \\'** appropriate assumptions \" or even the fruitfulness of the whole approach.) In this\\nsituation, the temptation might be strong to use the short-period approach to provide\\n** some rationalization \" of results which derived their plausibility only from a long-run\\nanalysis.\\n\\nUniversity of Florence P. GAREGNANI\\n\\n1 See p. 423.\\n\\n2 See p. 425, n. 2.\\n\\n3 Indeed the difficulties Dr. Bliss feels are those which led to the distinction between \\'* market \" and\\n** natural \" or * normal \" price, and to a concentration on the latter so as to be able to abstract, in Marshall\\'s\\nwords, from those \\'* irregular causes \"\" whose action *\\' is fitful and short lived \".

Insofar as fiscal policy is used,\\nthe proportion of output devoted to investment could be constant only if the composition\\nof public spending were deliberately manipulated with this end in view. The postulate of a\\nfull-employment fiscal policy therefore implies that one would still have to use the Keynesian\\nanalysis, with the difference that it would be used to determine the overall savings ratio\\nrather than the level of output. Matters are different if one postulates with Meade ([9],\\np. 3) that full employment is preserved solely by an active monetary policy. With a pro-\\nportional consumption function that is unaffected by interest-rate changes, monetary policy\\nwould operate solely on the level of investment. One could therefore reconcile full employ-\\nment, a constant savings ratio, and a Keynesian process of income determination.\\n\\nBoth of the two assumptions that would vindicate use of the neo-classical model are\\nrestrictive. Unless one believes that one or other of them provide a useful approximation\\nto reality, the neo-classical model must be interpreted as an asymptotic model only. Unless\\nthe initial conditions are such as to locate one in the unstable zone of Fig. 1, the Keynesian\\nmodel will lead to an asymptotic solution that is consistent with the neo-classical model,\\nbecause the equilibrium point lies on the W — 0 curve. A rise in the savings ratio will\\nultimately lead to a higher level of income, as the neo-classical model predicts. But it will\\nnot necessarily lead to an immediate increase in the rate of growth; the Paradox of Thrift\\nonly disappears after one has allowed a sufficient lapse of time for the depression in the\\nprice level to stimulate monetary ease and thereby investment. The neo-classical growth\\nmodel is an excellent asymptotic model, just as the classical model of income determination\\nis an excellent guide to the level of income 20 years hence provided there are no exogenous\\nshocks in the interim. But neither the neo-classical growth model nor the classical income\\nmodel tell one anything about the actual rate of growth (of output or capacity) or the actual\\nlevel of income next year. For such purposes it is necessary to study the actual forces that\\ndetermine investment, and the most important of these forces is the desire of businessmen\\nto invest rather than the full-employment level of savings. Those concerned with the practi-\\ncal problems of stimulating growth may not have doubted this; but, if so, it is in spite of\\nrather than because of the formal growth models that have been constructed.\\n\\nLondon JoHN WILLIAMSON\\n\\nFirst version received August 1968; final version received May 1969\\n\\nREFERENCES\\n[I] Bergstrom, A.

      "{'found': 'ESTIMATING DEMAND SYSTEMS UNDER SEPARABLE UTILITY 273\\n\\nof the utility interaction between goods in the various groups at a given level of utility\\nindicated by the income elasticity of the marginal utility of money. Information on this\\nelasticity and on the utility interactions cannot be derived from the present results. As\\n\\n-ài M. 1 M\\nit would appear that little more of a quantitative or qualitative nature can be said about the\\nrestrictiveness of the separability hypothesis for the utility function or the apparent inevit-\\nability of the dominance of the income effects under these conditions.\\n\\nIt is worth noting that the results under additivity do not support Green\\'s! result. The\\nhypothesis of direct additivity implies that either (a) all goods are normal and substitutes for\\neach other; or (b) one good is normal and a substitute for every other good, the remaining\\ngoods are either all inferior and complementary with each other or all neutral and unrelated\\nto each other. One good (bread) was inferior and was a net complement for all other goods.\\nThis divergence might be taken as evidence that consumer\\'s do not engage in maximising be-\\nhaviour. An alternative conclusion would be that the consumer\\'s utility function is not,\\nin fact, additive and in view of the likelihood ratio tests it is this which the author would\\nfavour.\\n\\nHowever, it is still possible that the basic hypothesis is incorrect—that consumers do\\nnot maximize utility. This conclusion would be supported by the application of a likelihood\\nratio test to the results under the Slutsky restrictions alone (Table 9). The Slutsky restric-\\ntions were rejected and it therefore became impossible for the various separability hypo-\\nthesis to be accepted as they impose more severe restrictions on the income compensated\\nsubstitution terms than mere symmetry. If this were not so it would be possible that the\\nconsumers do maximise utility but not according to the budgeting pattern implied by the\\nseparability hypotheses considered here.\\n\\nIt is quite likely that the method adopted to test the hypotheses was unduly severe. The\\nrestrictions are imposed at the mean proportion of expenditure devoted to each good and\\ndo not hold exactly at any point in time. Anyhow, with changing tastes and a general shift\\nup the utility function it is likely that such local conditions are not hypotheses worth testing.\\nIt is also possible that the choice of a log linear demand function affected the results as no\\nglobal utility function can correspond to such a representation of the demand equations.\\nFinally, it is possible that the grouping chosen was simply incorrect—a change of grouping\\nmay lead to more favourable results. The evidence presented here weighs pretty heavily\\nagainst the Slutsky and separability hypotheses but the conclusion may well be that it is\\nmeaningless to test such hypotheses in a static framework given the data the econometrician\\nis forced to work with.\\n\\nAustralian National University R.

The question I wish to investigate\\nis whether, when uncertainty can be measured by variance, an increase in the uncertainty\\nin the yield of the asset will cause the proportion of wealth invested in it to decline (if\\nthat is possible). I only look at the case of an *\\' interior \" solution since the other cases\\nfollow quite trivially.\\n\\nLet h(ri) — U\\'(c(k(1)))r;. Then taking U to be homogeneous, and using the notation\\nof I, we find:\\n\\n, , A*w\\nh\\' — U\\'(c(k(1)) | 1—a —— r, (a)\\nk(1) ...(5)\\nU\\'Aw A*w\\np - 1-9) [ 5 r,-1 b\\nKQ) [ ?

But then from our\\ndiscussion in I we know that an increase in the variance of r,, leaving E(r;) unchanged,\\nmust cause E[U\\'r,] to fall, and this means that in the new situation, a marginal transfer\\nto asset of type 1 reduces expected utility in period (1) (whereas previously it left it un-\\nchanged). Hence for given c(0) the proportion of wealth invested in asset 1 will decline.\\nHowever (4) is clearly independent of w and so of c(0), when U is homogeneous and\\nHQ da 0. Hence whatever the effect of the changed variance on c(0), the conclusion\\nstands: the proportion of wealth invested in the asset will decline.\\n\\nIt is clear that this (quite expected), result must be kept distinct from an answer to the\\nquestion of how an increase in the variance will effect the total amount of the asset bought.\\nIf « «1, there is no problem, since we already know that less will be saved. When a» 1,\\nthe matter is more problematical. Indeed the reader can construct examples, for which\\nthe amount of the now riskier asset bought is increased.

(Mirrlees, who found approximate\\nexplicit solutions for c(a, k), had a much harder time still). I conclude that the exercise\\nis not to be taken in a practical spirit but rather as a demonstration that a rational planner\\nmay make more provision for the future when the future becomes more uncertain.

The elasticity with respect to tax-induced changes in the opportunity cost of\\nretained earnings appears to be substantially highei than the elasticity with respect to\\nthe ratio of maximum possible net profits to gross profits.\\n\\nAlthough these results support the original suggestion that tax policies designed to\\ninfluence the level and timing of corporate saving may have important effects on economic\\nstability and growth, the link between corporate saving and these policy aims must still\\nbe investigated. Changes in corporate saving may be stabilizing in two ways. First,\\ntax-induced changes in saving could (in principle) lead to higher investment during periods\\nof low aggregate demand and lower investment during periods of high aggregate demand.\\nBut the well-established evidence that investment occurs only after a substantial lag\\n(Eisner and Strotz [7]; Almon [1]; Eisner [6]), reduces the potential importance of such\\ncountercyclical policy, even if it is accepted that investment would be cyclically sensitive\\nto tax-induced changes in retained earnings. Second, if corporate saving does not affect\\nshort-run corporate investment but dividends do influence consumption, tax policies to\\ndecrease dividends during periods of high aggregate demand would be stabilizing. Although\\nthis may be a potentially useful way of reducing aggregate demand by *\\' forced saving \"\\'\\nin high income groups instead of by lower investment or decreased general consumption,\\nthe estimated lag structure indicates that such a policy could only be effective if the govern-\\nment\\'s recognition and implementation lags were sufficiently short.\\n\\nWhen we turn to the influence of tax policies on growth, the effectiveness of the\\ndifferential profits tax in influencing corporate saving raises two further questions. First,\\ndoes an increase in the internal availability of corporate funds lead to increased corporate\\ninvestment? Second, does an increase in corporate saving induce a corresponding decrease\\nin personal saving? If the answer to the first question is yes and the answer to the second\\nis no, tax policies to encourage corporate saving will increase aggregate investment. If the\\nanswer to both questions is yes, such tax policies will only shift investment from the non-\\ncorporate to the corporate sector. Finally, there is no effect on investment if the answer\\nto the first question is no and the answer to the second question is yes.\\n\\nPrevious attempts to estimate the effect of retained earnings on corporate investment\\nhave been handicapped by the high degree of multicollinearity between retained earnings,\\nprofits and sales. The tax-induced changes in the \"equilibrium \" ratios of retained\\nearnings to profits and sales that have occurred in Britain since 1950 may provide a useful\\nset of data with which to estimate the effects of retained earnings. This is currently being\\nexplored.\\n\\nAlthough the relation between corporate and personal saving has been the subject\\nof theoretical speculation, it has never been empirically estimated. Because both forms\\nof saving are cyclically volatile, multicollinearity problems again arise. The rise in dividends\\nafter 1958 and the relative fall that can be expected to follow the 1965 corporation tax\\nmay provide a sufficient departure from the secular and cyclical patterns to permit studying\\nthe effect of corporate retentions on personal saving.\\n\\nA preliminary examination of the data for the period after 1958 shows a sharp rise\\nin personal saving and a change in corporate financing from internal to external sources.\\nBut only a careful study will reveal whether the tax change had any qualitative effect on\\nthe total supply of saving and the level and pattern of investment.\\n\\nHarvard University M.

      "{'found': '104 REVIEW OF ECONOMIC STUDIES\\n\\n(ii) The restrictions become tighter if we want constant-coefficient lag functions.\\nTime-invariant costs and a long period of observing demands are prerequisites. Together\\nwith these, a long planning period is one additional joint sufficient condition which will\\ngive the desired result. Another condition which would also give constant coefficients\\nhinges on the assumption that the firm uses the * correct\" long-run cost minimizing\\nmatrix S* to value terminal stocks. In this case, constant horizon * rollover \" planning\\n(with the plan reformulted each period) would do, as inspection of equation (6.7) indicates.\\nPossibly other sufficient conditions can be imagined; their relative credibility would vary\\nfrom situation to situation.\\n\\n(iii) Within the above rather stringent limitations, the results of this paper indicate\\nthat a fairly complete theoretical justification can be provided for the use of distributed\\nlag functions, thus filling a gap pointed out by Griliches [9] and other authors. Moreover,\\nthe model presented here integrates and generalizes the partial adjustment and adaptive\\nexpectations justifications for distributed lags. The use of the Kalman filter generalizes\\nthe original one-period adaptive expectations model of Cagan [4] to the multi-period\\nadaptive predictor (3.1) (paralleling results of Nerlove [14] and collaborators), while at\\nthe same time the use of cost functions including the control variables is very much in\\nthe spirit of the partial adjustment investment models of Eisner and Strotz [7], Lucas [13]\\nand Gould [8]. As in these models, current policy must be determined in light of all future\\nchanges in the parameters of the problem. \"With the present specification, this dependence\\nis given by the linear feedback rule (5.9) for determining present control variables as a\\nfunction of the variable g, which * summarizes \" the expected future according to the\\nlinear difference equation (5.11). Since all the relevant equations are linear and stable,\\nthe future expected values in (5.11) can be reduced to a distributed lag function of past\\nobservations via the Kalman filter. In the general case of non-linear constraints and\\nnon-quadratic costs, this reduction will not be possible, although linearizations about a\\nnon-linear feedback rule might sometimes be feasible.\\n\\n(iv) In summary, the ** good \" and ** bad \" results of this paper are somewhat mixed.\\nOn the one hand (abstracting from aggregation problems), sufficient conditions for nice\\ndistributed lag equations are shown here to exist; on the other hand, the conditions are\\nfairly tight and the equations they imply are unidentifiable in terms of the firm\\'s cost\\nand demand parameters. Further, not much relaxation of these conditions in the quadatic-\\nlinear model is likely, nor can nice equations be deduced in other types of optimizing models.\\nOn balance, the results seem somewhat negative, although the idea that firms somehow\\nmanage to find the cost-minimizing S* matrix to value their terminal stocks is perhaps\\nacceptable as a working hypothesis.\\n\\nHarvard University and LANCE TAYLOR\\nODEPLAN, Santiago, Chile\\n\\nFirst version received January, 1969; final version received March, 1969\\n\\nAPPENDIX ON STABILITY\\n\\nHere I amplify the discussion of observability and controllability given in the text,\\nand also give a sketch of the proofs of theorems 1 and 2 when all costs are time invariant.\\nFor more details, see [3], [11], [12] and additional citations there.\\n\\nA-1.

The paper\\nargues that in postwar U.S. quarterly data, consumption is smooth because it responds with a lag\\nto changes in income.\\n', '', \"INTRODUCTION\\n\\nOne of the most striking features of aggregate consumption behaviour is that aggregate\\nconsumption is smooth relative to aggregate income. Shifts in aggregate income are\\nassociated with relatively small shifts in aggregate consumption, and variations in con-\\nsumption about trend are smaller than variations in income about trend. The textbook\\nexplanation for these facts is that consumption is determined by permanent income not\\nby current income, and permanent income is smooth relative to current income. Innova-\\ntions to income generate relatively small innovations to permanent income, and thus to\\nconsumption. Hence, if the smoothness of consumption relative to income is taken to\\nrefer to the relative variance of innovations (a definition we adopt throughout this paper),\\nsmoothness is explained by permanent income theory. Indeed, the smoothness of con-\\nsumption is one of the principal raisons d'etre for the permanent income formulation.\\n\\nHowever, there is no logical necessity that permanent income must be smoother than\\ncurrent income. Beveridge and Nelson (1981) showed that the innovation variance of\\npermanent income will exceed that of current income if the growth rate of current income\\nis predominantly positively auto-correlated, while Nelson and Plosser (1982) argued that\\nthe growth rates of many macroeconomic time series, including real and nominal GDP,\\nfollow first-order moving average processes with a positive moving average coefficient.\\nDeaton (1987) drew out the implications of these results for the consumption function,\\narguing that permanent income is indeed noisier than current income so that permanent\\nincome theory fails to offer any straightforward and well-supported account of why\\nconsumption is smoother than income.\\n\\nIn the present paper, we attempt to do three things. First, in Section 2, we build a\\nbivariate model of saving and labour income that recognizes the fact that consumers are\\nlikely to be able to predict their incomes better than would an outsider with access only\\nto the past history of the series. The more information that consumers have, the smoother\\nwill be their consumption, so that a test of excess smoothness must be robust to possible\\neconometric misspecification of the consumer's information set. We show that such a test\\ncan be constructed around a simple bivariate vector autoregression (VAR), and we find\\n\\n357\\n\", 'This content downloaded from\\n137.158.158.62 on Sun, 13 Feb 2022 15:26:34 UTC\\nA]l use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\\n']\n",

The record over the 1970's shows that attempts to end inflation were\\noften abandoned shortly after they were announced.

INTRODUCTION\\n\\nThis paper considers a simple, asymmetric model of bilateral monopoly (bargaining)\\nunder uncertainty in which a single seller, with one object to sell, faces a single buyer.\\nThe seller announces a price for the object, which the buyer can either accept or reject.\\nIf the offer is accepted, then the object is transferred at the announced price; otherwise,\\nthe process continues with the seller announcing another price. Waiting is assumed to\\nbe costly to both buyer and seller. The one-period (stage) version of this model has\\nbeen analysed by W. Samuelson (1980); Chatterjee and W. Samuelson (1981) consider\\nthe one-stage bilateral monopoly problem where both players make offers and a sale is\\nmade, at a compromise price, if the buyer offers at least as much as the seller.\\n\\nTwo aspects of the bilateral monopoly problem are of particular interest to us. First,\\nif the seller has incomplete information about the buyer's willingness to pay, then there\\nmay be situations in which the buyer and seller fail to make a transaction at the first\\nprice even though gains from trade are available. Thus incomplete information about\\npreferences may cause bargaining impasses. Impasses can take the form of costly delays\\nbefore agreement is reached, or of an ex post inefficiency, the complete failure to make\\na beneficial transaction. If the seller realizes that there are unexploited opportunities for\\ntrade after the first offer is rejected, it is reasonable to assume that the bargaining process\\nshould continue; that is, bargaining should proceed in stages until all potential benefits\\nare exhausted (in our model this takes the form of a sale being made or the discovery\\nthat no mutually beneficial sale is possible).\\n\\nOnce we assume that the bargaining takes place in stages, the second issue arises.\\nWhat is the appropriate equilibrium concept? In principle, which bargainer makes offers\\nshould be determined endogenously. The assumption that only the seller makes offers\\nallows us to draw conclusions about the sensitivity of outcomes to bargaining costs and\\nthe number of periods that are true in more general settings. One possibility is to look\\nfor strategies that maximize the expected profits of the seller assuming that the buyer,\\ntaking prices as given, buys in the period that maximizes his discounted surplus.

INTRODUCTION\\n\\nThe description of social decision mechanisms as non-cooperative game forms has recently\\nbeen the subject of much research. This note concerns two properties of game forms\\nwhich have attracted particular interest. Hurwicz and Schmeidler (1978) studied game\\nforms which are acceptable in the sense that every profile of player characteristics admits\\na Nash equilibirum and every Nash equilibrium outcome is Pareto optimal. Gibbard\\n(1973) termed a game form straightforward if there is a dominant strategy for each\\nplayer characteristic. To avoid repetition, in this paper the term straightforward will be\\napplied only to game forms with the additional property that every dominant strategy\\nequilibrium is Pareto optimal. This note describes an example of a natural economic\\ndecision problem for which there exist non-dictatorial acceptable game forms and\\nnon-dictatorial straightforward game forms, but no non-dictatorial game forms have\\nboth properties. In other words, any game form with well behaved dominant strategy\\nequilibria must have badly behaved non-dominant strategy equilibria. Moreover, there\\nexist non-dictatorial acceptable game forms with a unique equilibrium outcome for each\\nprofile, and which cannot be advantageously manipulated by any player, even if he is\\npermitted to adopt behaviour which could not be rationalized as Nash behaviour for any\\nplayer characteristic. Hence the example suggests that it may be inappropriate to insist\\non the existence of dominant strategies as a test of whether \\'\\'honesty is the best policy\".\\n\\nAcceptable and straightforward game forms have attracted interest as decentralized\\nincentive-compatible mechanisms for implementing social decision rules. Straightfor-\\nwardness is intuitively the stronger property, and is generally more difficult to attain.\\nHowever, it is also known that, at least in the setting of abstract social choice theory,\\nthere exist social decision rules which can be implemented by straightforward game\\nforms but not by acceptable game forms (Dasgupta, Hammond and Maskin (1979) p.\\n211). The example described below involves a decision rule which can be implemented\\nin both ways, but not simultaneously.\\n', '369\\n', 'This content downloaded from 137.158.158.62 on Thu, 17 Feb 2022 09:08:55 UTC\\nA]l use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\\n']\n",

The\\nmodel differs only in minor respects from that considered by Stiglitz and Dasgupta in the\\nsecond half of their paper: by not explicitly allowing for public goods, by assuming one\\nconsumer (which, however, amounts to the same thing as assuming many equally treated\\nidentical consumers) and by treating homothetic production functions as a special case.\\nSection 3 contains the characterization of the optimal tax structure under various assump-\\ntions, and in Section 4 the results are summarized.\\n', '', \"2.
